      <p class="NNHS">Neurophysiology</p>
      <p class="Sub1">Roles and Responsibilities</p>
      <p class="Li">Neurophysiology is a job to diagnose people's neurological condition. For example epilepsy. </p>
      <p class="Sub"> A Neurophysiologist works in many hospital settings such as: </p>
      <ul class="Li">
        <li>General Wards</li>
        <li>Operation Theatre</li>
        <li>Emergency Departments</li>
        <li>Community Settings</li>
        <li>Intensive Care</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="Sub">On a typical day, a Neurophysiologist would conduct:</p>
      <ul class="Li">
        <li>EEG (Electroencephalography) - This is conducting a recording of the electrical activity in the brain from the scalp. This is largely used to diagnose and monitor Epilepsy.</li>
        <li>EMG (Electromyography) and NCS (Nerve Conduction Studies) - these assess the functioning of the nerves and muscles within the body. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is commonly diagnosed using NCS. EMG is used in conditions affecting nerve and muscle function including myasthenia gravis and motor neuron disease.</li>
        <li>Evoked Potentials - these are potentials produced by a brain in response to a certain stimulus for example a flashing light. These are used to diagnose various conditions including multiple Sclerosis.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="Sub1">Qualifications, Experience and Skills:</p>
      <p class="Sub">Some Soft Skills Required are: </p>
